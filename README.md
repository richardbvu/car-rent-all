# How It's Made
Built with : 
* Vanilla Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

This project was purposely created without relying on Javascript frameworks or CSS frameworks to demonstrate my strong understanding of core fundamentals.
Based on my strong understanding of core fundamentals, I can easily and quickly learn any additional frameworks required.

# Lessons Learned
I've learned countless lessons that I'm proud of. Here's some lessons that I'd like to share: 

* The way I write my HTML makes a large difference. For example, as I was creating a responsive drop-down menu, I realized that the drop-down wasn't working as intended because all of my elements including my logo was under a single parent. If I had the links and buttons under a separate parent, I could have saved myself time and prevented myself from writing double the CSS for both the links and buttons.

* Planning your project before you begin will have a significant effect on success. For example, there are multiple options to create a modal (or anything I wish to create), each with its own pros and cons. My first thought was creating the modal on my own, which would require much more CSS and additional Javascript. With more research and planning, I decided to use the dialog element. The dialog element has its own functions and attributes which I could use as the modal. I understand that not every feature I wish to create will have a dialog element I can use in my projects, but in this case, it was suitable for my project.

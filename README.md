# How It's Made
Tech used: Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS

This project was purposely created without relying on Javascript frameworks or CSS frameworks to demonstrate my strong understanding of core fundamentals.
From my strong understanding of core fundamentals, I can easily and quickly learn any additional frameworks required.

# Lessons Learned:
I've learned countless lessons that I'm proud of. Here's some lessons that I'd like to share: 

* The way I write my HTML makes a large difference. For example, I wanted to create a drop-down menu without moving my logo. This caused an issue. As I was creating the responsive drop-down menu, I realized that the drop-down wasn't working as intended because all of my elements including my logo was under a single parent. Looking back, if I had my links and buttons under a single parent (excluding my logo), I could have saved myself time and prevented myself from writing additional CSS.

* Planning your project before you begin will have a significant effect on success. For example, there are multiple options to create a modal (or anything I wish to create), each with its own pros and cons. My first thought was creating the modal on my own, which would require much more CSS and additional Javascript. With more research and planning, I decided to use the dialog element. The dialog element has its own functions and attributes which I could use as the modal. I understand that not every feature I wish to create will have a dialog element I can use in my projects, but in this case, it was suitable for my project.
